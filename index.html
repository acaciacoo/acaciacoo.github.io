When Halloween night came, there was a Bloodmoon! So Duke the vampire went and scared people while Wyatt the ghoul floated around. Emily and Abby the witch went trick-or-treating. They went to lots of scary houses and got lots of candy while Socks and his friends were had pumpkins full of candy and there bags stuffed! They all were having a great time until a greedy ghost stoll all of there candy! They tried to get it back but the greedy ghost flew away. So Emily and Abby got on there brooms and flew after the ghost. Emily dropped her wand and Blackheart caught it. Blackheart casted a spell on the ghost and just then a bat grabbed the candy! The bat ate two peices and then Wyatt the ghoul stoll the candy from the bat and gave it to Emily. Then the evil witch Hanah stoll the cats and flew away. Emily tried to go after her but she threatened to do a evil curse on her so she just had to watch Socks and his friends fly away. Then Bob sneaked into the witch's house and got the cats back.
